      <h2> Heat Vulnerability an Issue in NYC as Climate Change Rages on</h2>
      <h4>By: Hafeezat A. Bishi | Dec. 19, 2021 </h4>

 <div>
  <!-- Intro text goes here -->
  <p> The COVID-19 pandemic put a pause on regular daily life activity, which caused a reduction of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7834155/#:~:text=The%20weekly%20energy%20demand%20was,the%20whole%20year%20of%202020."> energy use</a> as folks were urged to stay home. Areas of the world with the worst smog and air quality were able to see <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57149747">clearer skies</a>, and breathe cleaner air. However, despite the reprieve we experienced last year, climate change continued to cause issues in the United States throughout 2021. California continued to battle <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/climate/climate-change-wildfire-risk.html">wildfires</a>, Hurricane Ida caused mass destruction and deaths in <a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2021-09-02-hurricane-ida-recap-louisiana-south-northeast">Louisiana and the Northeast</a>, and several states faced <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-excessive-heat-wave-11629392901">extreme highs</a> over the summer.

  <p>In 2018, the New York City Department of Health compiled data on the city's most and least heat vulnerable areas. They note that a lower heat vulnerability index does not mean that risk is not present. However, the map above as well as <a href="https://welcome2thebronx.com/2018/07/12/half-of-nycs-twelve-most-heat-vulnerable-communities-are-in-the-bronx/">accompanying data</a> shows that areas with lower income households and/or majority Black and Brown communities, like the South Bronx and Brooklyn, have an increased risk of heat vulnerability compared to other populations in the city.

        <p> Issues of climate change require a lens of intersectionality. Discriminatory practices such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html">redlining</a> exacerbate the impact of climate change amongst minority populations. From 2000 - 2012, Black New Yorkers died at a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief47.pdf">higher rate</a> from heat related causes, making up 50% of heat related deaths during that time period. Climate change isn't making things much better, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency is stating that the number of days over 90°F could <a href="https://www.epa.gov/arc-x/new-york-city-adapts-deal-projected-increase-heat-waves">triple by 2050</a> in NYC. Heat waves "are something that we're going to have to deal with every single year,” Annel Hernandez, the associate director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, told City and State New York. This means that adaptation and preemptive measures are needed now more than ever.
        </p>

        <p>The city is continuing to implement efforts to combat the onslaught of environmental issues that have been caused by climate change. In 2015, the city planted its 1 millionth tree from the <em>Million TreesNYC</em> initiative started in 2007. They've invested millions of dollars into planting trees across the city, prioritizing more vulnerable areas, installed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/realestate/cool-roofs-climate-change-nyc.html">Cool Roofs</a> over several buildings to reflect heat instead of absorbing it, and created <a href="https://maps.nyc.gov/cooling-center/inactive.html?1639945200000">cooling centers</a> for community members to enter during hotter days. All of this and more can help make the city safer for residents now and in the future as the uncertainty of climate change continues to loom overhead.</p>
